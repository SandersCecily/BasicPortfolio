# BasicPortfolio

## Introduction
This was a homework assignment where we were given three images of a site and told to recreate said site. This was my verison of that. Improvements can be made in the file structure and generally in the code itself as it's very basic. The point of this was a template to give ourselves a template of a working portfolio to show employers. I personally wasn't a fan of this layout. 

## Technologies used:
This uses simple HTML and CSS.
